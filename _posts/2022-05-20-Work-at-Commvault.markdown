I still remember the first day of my internship - seniors informed me that my manager works out of the office in the US and my mentor works out of Hyderabad. I was scared, and started pondering how will I figure out the things here in Bangalore.   

That evening I had a call with my mentor. He greeted me warmly by introducing himself and made me feel comfortable. He briefed me about the work we do in the team and the products/features the team builds. The very next day I had a call with my manager where he asked me about my previous projects in the college. He gave a gist of what I will be working on in the initial days of my internship. After these two visitations, I was relaxed and less worried. 

As the days progressed I was introduced to the product and was assigned some tasks. I got great support both from my manager and my mentor in getting done my initial tasks. My manager was very clear about the goals he wanted me to achieve, which gave me a lot of clarity on my work. The one thing which I liked here at Commvault was that I was able to push my code to production from the very first month. As the days passed I was handed over very business-critical projects. I was involved in critical design improvements of the product and I was given complete freedom to go and make changes to the implementation of the design changes. I should be thankful to my manager for believing in me with critical tasks. 

With almost two years into development, now I own the development of a product and have significant contributions in development of a few subsystems. I should be thankful to my manager and my mentor for all their guidance throughout my journey so far as a Software Engineer here at Commvault. 

Key learnings:
	* Have a clear understanding of what is expected from you. 
	* Have regular discussions with the manager and mentor about the progress of the work. 
	* Always reach out for help. 
	* Never accept things like how they are, always ask why it is implemented the way it is. 
	* Have regular 1-on-1 meetings with the manager.
