Hey, it's been a while since I last wrote anything. Life has been moving at a whirlwind pace, and I thought it’s time to pause and share a bit of what's been going on. A lot of changes, a lot of transformations—some expected, others unexpected.

The biggest change? I’m engaged! Yes, I’ve found the love of my life—Aishu. I can’t seem to take my eyes off her whenever she’s around. She’s understanding, though there’s still so much for both of us to learn about life. But that’s what life is all about, right? Seeing things from someone else’s perspective and evolving together. I truly believe we’ll be perfect for each other.

On the career front, it’s been an exciting journey. Work has been fulfilling, and I couldn’t have asked for more. I’ve been part of a fantastic AD project, where I learned so much and contributed significantly to the team. One of my goals has always been to create a sense of dependency within my team, and I’m happy to see that happening. I even had the opportunity to mentor interns directly. Of course, there’s always room for improvement in how I guide them, but I believe not everything should be spoon-fed. It’s all about growth. The compensation has been great too, and I’m happy with the stock options I’ve received so far. Honestly, I feel like I’m living the dream in my career.

But there’s one thing I’ve been neglecting—reading books. I really need to make time for that again. Time management is key, and I’m still figuring out how to use my time wisely. In terms of health, I think I’m doing okay. I’ve been making an effort to stay active, whether it’s going to the gym or getting into badminton. I have to say, it’s one of the best decisions I’ve made. There’s still a long way to go, but I’m optimistic about how things will unfold.

Now, when it comes to finances, the past year has been a bit of a free-for-all. I didn’t budget much; I was just enjoying life and living in the moment, as many would call it. No regrets at all. However, post-marriage, there will definitely need to be more planning in that area. I’m curious to see how it’ll go—excited and a bit anxious about it too. Looking back, I’ve witnessed the huge market crash since the pandemic, but the silver lining is that consistency has paid off in my investments. I’m still in the green. Moving forward, it’s about staying disciplined, continuing with SIPs, and keeping a cool head in this volatile market.

As for the future, there’s a lot of uncertainty ahead. Life is changing, and so is my career. I’ve been thinking about wrapping up my work on the AD clean OS project and possibly considering a job change. I feel like I’ve reached a point where there’s no higher rung to climb in this role. There’s a sense of stagnation, and I’m ready for the next challenge.

Life-wise, a lot of adaptation is coming. It’s going to be about letting go of my individual ways and merging them with someone else’s—building a life together. I really hope Aishu and I can see life through similar lenses and grow as a team. I’m both excited and a bit nervous about what’s coming next, but I’m doing my best to be prepared for whatever the future holds.

Here’s to the unknown, to change, and to the beautiful chaos that comes with it. Let’s see what life has in store!
