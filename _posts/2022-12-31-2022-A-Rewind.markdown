It has been a wonderful year with many things happening. Life has settled into a routine, and moving back to Bangalore has been beneficial.

Personally, I traveled more after the lockdown and caught up with friends. I explored different places in Karnataka such as Hampi, Shivamogga, Tirupati, Kanchi, and Mahabalipuram. I also traveled for the first time with my PES classmates and got to know them more personally. I enjoyed driving my car throughout the year, which was a good decision to buy it on my own after convincing my parents. This year, I attempted to focus more on my health by reading more about it and trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle, but unfortunately, I failed to make it a routine. My goal for 2023 is to focus on health, meditation, and clean eating.

Workwise, it has been a good year. I started working more closely with SharePoint systems and gained knowledge about distributed systems and CPP. However, there is still a lot to learn, and I am enjoying my work at Commvault. My goal for 2023 is to grow as an independent software engineer and understand the maximum out of the systems in my team.

I also made the decision not to pursue my master's in the US after considering the tradeoffs and risks involved. Instead, my goal is to grow my career in India and explore options to go to the US through work.

I also read a good number of books this year, and "Atomic Habits" had a significant impact on me. Understanding how the mind functions is fascinating.

Investment-wise, it has been an average year. The markets have started to pick up, and I hope 2023 will be a great year. 2022 was also the year when many tech stocks crashed due to the economic downturn. My goal for 2023 is to diversify my portfolio, invest in gold ETFs, and resume investing in index funds.
